Google_Stock_Price_forecasting
This repository contains a comprehensive project for forecasting Google stock prices using advanced deep learning techniques. Leveraging Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and popular Python libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras, this project aims to deliver accurate predictions and insightful analysis. The workflow integrates robust data preprocessing and model evaluation using Sklearn, with detailed visualizations facilitated by Matplotlib.

The project starts with data collection and preprocessing, ensuring the stock price data is cleaned and normalized for optimal performance. It then moves on to building and training the ANN and RNN models, with a specific focus on LSTM due to its effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. TensorFlow and Keras provide the backbone for model development, enabling efficient construction, training, and tuning of deep learning models.

Sklearn is utilized for evaluating model performance through metrics and validation techniques, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the predictions. Finally, Matplotlib is employed to create comprehensive visualizations that illustrate the model's predictions versus actual stock prices, helping users understand the effectiveness and accuracy of the forecasting models.
